# Hands-on-II

# Income Classification and Regression Models


## Project Overview


In this project, I have built both classification and regression models using the Income dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project is to explore and predict income levels using different machine learning techniques.

## Models Developed


## Classification Models:


Logistic Regression


Decision Tree


Random Forest Classifier


Gradient Boosting Classifier


K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Regression Models:


Linear Regression


Random Forest Regressor


Ridge and Lasso Regression


Gradient Boosting Regressor


Ridge, Lasso Regression and Elasti Regressions

Each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for regression.


## Why Use Google Colab?


All the code for this project is written in Google Colab, an excellent platform for data science and machine learning projects. I highly recommend using Google Colab due to its user-friendly environment and powerful features:


Free GPU/TPU Access: Speed up your model training with free access to GPUs and TPUs.
Interactive Notebooks: Google Colab allows you to write and execute code in an interactive notebook format, making it ideal for quick experimentation.
No Setup Required: No need to install software or manage environments. Just open a new notebook and start coding!
You can explore the entire project and run the code interactively using Google Colab for a smooth and hassle-free experience.
